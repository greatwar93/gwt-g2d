==What's new==

  * Matrix class
  * Video and audio playback (experimental state)
  * Support transformation in ShapeBuilder
  * Support CanvasPattern, toDataURL, draw video onto canvas, etc.

==Media playback==

This version is a major feature add. Most Canvas features are now fully supported in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox (and IE via Google Chrome Frame). Opera 10.5 pre-alpha also looks pretty promising. So from now on gwt-g2d will also put some focus on media playback (video and audio), as it is also part of what gwt-g2d had set out to do. This version contains a draft gwt wrapper for the video and audio element. However, they are not yet widely supported across the major browsers. Interested parties are highly encouraged to try out and provide feedbacks on the interface.
